### About Me
I'm a dual Bachelor's student in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence with a strong
interest in building **clear, reproducible machine learning solutions**.

I focus on understanding data and assumptions before modeling and prefer
**simple, well-structured approaches** over complex black-box solutions.
Most of my learning happens through hands-on implementation and iteration.
